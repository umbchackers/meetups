# meetups
Create meetups that will allow you to congregate with people who share a commonality in order to forge friendships that last far beyond a hackathon.

This would be ideal for hackUMBC to allow people to form new relationships and to create a sense of belonging for groups that may not otherwise feel welcome.

## Workflow
1. The user arrives at the Meetups homepage.
2. The user logs in with their Quill account.
3. The user can either create a meetup or say they'll attend existing planned meetups.

## Safety
- All meetups will be screened for anything inappropriate.
- There will be an organizer or volunteer at each meetup to ensure nothing bad occurs.
